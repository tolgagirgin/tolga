Pebble Text Watch
=================

On the first launch of Pebble SDK, TextWatch application was not part of the code examples.
Many people wanted to change the texts into their own language and with this app we hope that others will improve it 
and translate it into many more languages.

A video with the text changing animation can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVTCtfZ-GsU

Compiled build: http://c.wip.ro/0t0i0J172R2Q
